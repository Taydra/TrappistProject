\section{Background}
Less than 2 years ago, scientists discovered the exoplanetary system TRAPPIST-1, the first known system consisting of 7 planets. A vast majority of exoplanets are gas giants, but all the planets in the TRAPPIST-1 system are close to an Earth mass, and some of them are in the classical ``habitable zone'', meaning their solar irradiance is is similar to $1361 \si{\watt \per \meter^2}$. Needless to say, TRAPPIST-1 was a very exciting discovery for astronomers, particularly the planets TRAPPIST-1 d, e, and f, which are currently our most likely candidates for a habitable exoplanet. According to solar system formation dynamics, we expect planets like TRAPPIST, which orbit very closely to a very dim start, to be tidally locked, meaning there is a substellar point where the sun is always overhead, a terminator, where the sun is constantly setting, and an anti-stellar point, which never sees the sun.
